# QuizOpp

This project is a modern, real-time, one-on-one quiz application inspired by QuizUp.

### Tech Stack

**Next.js:** Frontend framework. Using its server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities for the landing page to improve SEO. It also supports client-side rendering (CSR), which will be used for more dynamic pages such as the actual competition aspect of the app.

**FastAPI:** I figured using Python and FastAPI would be nice for this project just in case I wanted to incorporate my own AI as opponents.

**Websockets:** Used for real-time interactions between players.

**PostgreSQL:** Storing information about matches, players, quizzes, questions, and more.
